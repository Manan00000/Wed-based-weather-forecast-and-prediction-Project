# Wed-based-weather-forecast-and-prediction-Project
Javascript Based weather forecast Project made with the help of OpenWeather API
Hello Reader,
My name is Manan Bahuguna I am a student at graphic era hill university Dehradun ,currently persuing bachelor in Computer science. This text file gives my detailed account on weather forcast website as a part of my virtual internship with dilwado.com .
TIMELINE:
week 1:The First week was spent creating the basic layout of the website with the help of HTML and CSS with different areas for navbar,table cards, heading,etc.
week 2: This week was spent with the nightmare that javascript was with different API and other such elements as well as adding map as an element and streamlining all different parts.
week 3: Thanks to me not noticing the part of pdf that said there were 2 levels of the project this week was spent implementing search history and 5 day weather forcast table.

FILES:
HTML and CSS files:
The HTML file can be divided into 5 main types:
	1.The Navbar containing heading, about button ,search bar and search button.
	2.The table depecting the latest forcast for place that has been searched for in the search bar.
	3.Search history storing the last 5 cities.
	4.5 day forcast of the place that has been searched for.
	5.Map of the place from google maps imbedded API.
CSS file, it contains the mess that is the styling sheet for HTML.
JavaScript File:
The JavaScript for the project has some important parts, first the api from Open Weather for 2 separate things(latest weather forecast and 5 day weather forcast) along with my personal API key. The API shares value into JSON datatype. Second part is the latest forcast of the place searched for ,it includes data such as temperature, pressure, sunrise/set time ,etc. This part also contains the function that calculates the local time. The other parts include embedded map API form google maps ,search history of places stored in local storage and 5 day weather forcast for the place searched for.
